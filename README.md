Vendor files for LG Leon H340N, from https://http://opensource.lge.com/osSch/list?types=ALL&amp;search=h340n

OK, LG have structured their source code in a stupid way.
Really, really stupid.
Seriousely, go download one of them at http://opensource.lge.com/osSch/list?types=ALL&search=h340n

I can see the kernel is in a separate zip, and I've uplaoded that, but otherwise, wtf is going on???
I am following the instructions to build they packaged with it, and seeing of i can make sense of it later
